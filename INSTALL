1. Requirements
---------------

Before being able to build esp_edp.so you need libglib2.0-dev and
wireshark-dev for wireshark-1.0. Also a recent version of gcc and make is
required.

2. Building
-----------

You can start build of esp_edp.so just by starting 

$ make

in the source directory. Please change WIRESHARK_INCLUDE_PATH and
WIRESHARK_LIBRARY_PATH in Makefile if your wireshark development
files can't be located in /usr/include/wireshark and /usr/include/wireshark.
e.g. if you installed it in /opt/wireshark/include and /opt/wireshark/lib,
please change it to

WIRESHARK_INCLUDE_PATH = /opt/wireshark/include
WIRESHARK_LIBRARY_PATH = /opt/wireshark/lib


3. Installing
-------------

esp_edp.so can be installed by copying it to /usr/share/wireshark/plugins/
or $HOME/.wireshark/plugins/. Installation in you home directory can be
done by starting

$ make install

It's possible that you cannot use the plugin when you start wireshark as root.
Try to change permissions of the plugin to 0600 and the owner to root

$ chmod 0600 $HOME/.wireshark/plugins/esp_edp.so
$ chmod root:root $HOME/.wireshark/plugins/esp_edp.so

or try to enable suid for dumpcap and start it as normal user

$ chmod +s `which dumpcap`
